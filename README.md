# SxS (Side-by-Side) Settings

A Sublime Text plugin for viewing default and user settings side by side. Works
for key bindings too!

## Installation
There are two options for installing this package:

#### [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/) (Recommended)
SxS Settings is available on Package Control. If you do not have Package Control
installed in Sublime Text, you should! Simply follow
[these instructions](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) to install it. Once
it has been installed, search for and select  **SxS Settings** in the `Install
Package` command prompt.

#### Git Clone
You can also clone this repository into your Sublime Text Packages directory
using Git, if you're so inclined.

## Usage

SxS Settings adds two commands to the command palette:

* **SxS Settings** - Opens Sublime Text settings side by side in a new window
* **SxS Key Bindings** - Opens Sublime Text key bindings side by side in a new window

If you want to bind these commands to a shortcut key, the internal command names
to use in the binding are:

* sxs_settings
* sxs_key_bindings

## Future Development
At the moment, this plugin is pretty bare-bones. I have a number of items I'd
like to implement, each of which are listed on the GitHub issues list for this
project. Pull requests are welcome! Though I'm a fairly seasoned programmer, I'm
new to Python development, so if you see room for improvement, let me know.
